# proxy — the byte-safe standalone `caveman` proxy (commercial, binary-distributed)

A base-URL-swap reverse proxy: match → authenticate → inspect → byte-safe transform → upstream
→ meter. Single-operator, BYOK, **zero cloud dependencies**. It shares its provider adapters with
the managed gateway (the managed gateway imports them from here). `caveman start` launches the
`caveman-proxy` binary.

## Layout
- `providers/` — the shared, public byte-safe adapter set: `Adapter` interface + `Base` embed + `UsageScanner`/`ParseUsageBytes` (`adapter.go`), and `anthropic`/`openai`/`gemini`/`azureopenai`/`bedrock`/`vertex`/`openaicompat`. `ResolveUpstreamURL` takes `providers.RouteContext` (no control-plane coupling). Anthropic + OpenAI carry both prefixed and bare routes (`/v1/messages`, `/v1/chat/completions`). `vertex` preserves caller OAuth bearer or Express-mode Google API-key credentials for Gemini + Claude on Vertex AI (no signing, no environment-key fallback, no custom usage parser). `MatchRoute` is POST-only; read-only model discovery (`GET /v1/models`, `/v1/models/{id}`) is a separate GET-only allowlist, `Base.MetadataRoutes`, declared by `openai`/`anthropic`/`openaicompat` and forwarded unchanged with no body, no transform and no spend row. Bare `/v1/models` belongs to both `openai` and `anthropic`, so they implement `MetadataRequestMatcher` and choose by wire protocol (`anthropic-version` or `x-api-key` present → anthropic; a Google key matches neither), never by registration order (#1187).
- `internal/gateway/` — the request lifecycle (`server.go` + `proxy.go`) behind three injected seams: `Authenticator`, `CredentialResolver`, `TelemetrySink`. Ports the managed loop with the fail-open fix.
- `internal/config/` — `caveman.yaml` loader + BYOK env-key resolution; unknown mode fails closed to `record`.
- `internal/store/` — `~/.caveman/caveman.db` SQLite spend store (`modernc.org/sqlite`, cgo-free); implements `TelemetrySink`.
- `internal/standalone/` — wiring: static `Auth`, BYOK `Creds`, adapter set, and the always-on SSRF-guarded client.
- `internal/identity/` — who calls the framework middleware routes (legacy token, token map, OIDC/JWT, mTLS) and the reloadable TLS listener config.
- `cmd/caveman-proxy/` — binary: `serve` (default), `stats`, and content-blind
  `agent-evidence --session --build --plan`. Evidence query returns only exact
  provider usage, request hashes, declared context/plan identity, ordered
  provider-prefix component hashes, actual transform IDs/counts, and CCR handle;
  basis is always `inferred`, verified dollars always zero.

## Conventions
- Build/test: `make product-build PRODUCT=proxy` / `make product-test PRODUCT=proxy`.
- Tests inject a plain `*http.Client` to reach loopback stubs; the binary uses the SSRF-guarded client.
- New provider/optimizer work goes in `providers/` (shared) — change it once, both proxies get it.

## Gotchas (honesty invariants — correctness, not style)

- **listener lifetime is not session lifetime**: `serve` never exits because a
  wrapper, native session, heartbeat, or idle timer expires. Legacy
  `CAVEMAN_NATIVE_IDLE_TIMEOUT` does not arm shutdown. The CLI never restarts a
  shared listener to change mode/recovery; an incompatible new wrap runs direct.
  Failed local startup also runs direct. Native session correlation entries may
  age out without affecting API traffic.
- **no default generation deadline**: `CAVE_GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_MS` defaults
  to `0` (no total request deadline). A positive value is an explicit operator
  cap and includes response streaming. Client cancellation still cancels upstream;
  connection setup, inbound header/upload limits, and idle keep-alive socket
  cleanup remain bounded separately. The replacement bound for an upstream that
  connects and then goes silent is the transport's response-header deadline
  (`CAVE_GATEWAY_RESPONSE_HEADER_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 900000, `0` disables) —
  headers only, so it never truncates a live stream.
- **response protocol controls streaming**: SSE/event-stream responses flush
  headers and chunks even without a JSON `stream` flag. Encoded requests keep
  `Content-Encoding` and bypass transforms. Interrupted response copies record
  an error and abort HTTP framing; they never become a clean successful EOF.
- **replay only when non-delivery is proven**: proxy transport retries are
  limited to connection-setup failures — `*net.OpError` with `Op` `dial` or
  `proxyconnect` (a proxy that is down fails as the latter, never as a dial). A failed upload/header read or truncated response
  does not prove an inference was unprocessed; do not automatically replay it.
  An explicit transformed-request 4xx still retries once with original bytes —
  except a 429 that carries `Retry-After` (a rate limit; Anthropic sends its
  `anthropic-ratelimit-*` headers on every response, so they prove nothing),
  which is returned as-is; an accepted retry pins the conversation raw
  (`internal/gateway/raw_pin.go`).
  See `docs/technical/proxy-reliability.md` at the repository root.
- **byte-safe**: `record` mode never transforms; on transform error the ORIGINAL bytes are forwarded (HTTP 200, fail-open) — never a 400. The one carve-out: bytes the provider already cached in replaced form are re-sent replaced, because forwarding the original there busts the prefix (see cache safety).
- **request-wide opt-out**: `x-cave-transforms: caveman.pass-through.v1` suppresses every request transform path — compress, pixel, and provider-native — not only compiled plan routes. Tests cover all three modes.
- **no-fake-savings**: standalone records `Basis: "inferred"` on every row; it never writes `verified` and never re-projects to a monthly figure.
- **practice join**: local learn sinks carry additive `practice_id`; one
  fail-closed mapping table owns sink→practice and unknown sinks keep `""`.
  The historical `subagent_overuse` sink is count-only and deliberately has no
  practice id: spawn count cannot reactivate the retired
  `context-exploration-offload` opportunity or prove any spawn unnecessary.
- **local trial heuristics are not actuation evidence**: a model name never emits
  the retired `model-right-sizing` id, and provider plus positive cost never
  emits a cache move because neither proves stable-prefix eligibility. Legacy
  rows for those identities are hidden at read time. Compression replay reports
  one trial's local engine `estimated_engine_o200k` before/after shape with zero
  dollars and low confidence; it is not provider-counted, a rate, an invoice,
  causal/verified savings, or task-outcome evidence.
- **Anthropic automatic caching is experimental observation only**:
  `anthropic-automatic-prompt-cache` is a typed, default-off manual policy
  experiment and may add only Anthropic's top-level 5-minute marker on direct
  Messages API requests. Managed traffic additionally requires server-attested
  official Anthropic origin; custom or provenance-unknown origins lose the flag
  before the adapter. It is mutually
  exclusive with the explicit `anthropic-cache-breakpoints` transform and any
  caller `cache_control`; Bedrock and count-tokens requests stay byte-identical.
  An applied marker records only its optimizer id plus actual provider usage and
  cost. It has no practice, recipe, generic mode/candidate activation, ledger
  tuple, inferred savings, or verified-savings path (cache-only and forged IDs
  are excluded from the counted-baseline method too); evaluate it by manual
  paired observation because shared provider cache state can contaminate an A/B.
- **SSRF always on**: `standalone.StandaloneHTTPClient` guards every upstream dial (not gated on `CAVE_ENV`) using `ssrf.SelfHostedConfig` — NOT ManagedConfig, which ignores the allowlist and would make the escape hatch a silent no-op. `CAVE_SSRF_ALLOWLIST` opts loopback/private hosts back in (local model servers like Ollama; `localhost` as an entry covers 127.0.0.0/8 + ::1); metadata/link-local stay blocked in every mode. Provider traffic honours `HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY` by default (#1001) — `upstream_proxy: env|off|<url>` / `CAVE_UPSTREAM_PROXY` — via `ssrf.Config.Proxy`, which validates IP-literal/localhost destinations before proxy selection and dials the (operator-configured) proxy address unguarded; `ssrf.NewHTTPClient` itself stays direct unless a caller sets `Proxy`, and a managed-mode Config carrying one is refused loudly (every request fails with `ssrf.ErrProxyInManagedMode`) rather than silently dialing direct. Adapters that pre-flight a resolved endpoint (bedrock, vertex) read the selector off the request context (`providers.WithUpstreamProxy`, published by `gateway.Handler` from the upstream transport) and use `ssrf.ValidateURLNoResolve` for proxied destinations: a proxy-only network has no outbound DNS, so resolving there failed the request before the proxy was ever consulted. `ca_bundle` / `CAVE_CA_BUNDLE` plus inherited `SSL_CERT_FILE`/`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`/`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` append private roots for TLS inspection through `shared/platform/cabundle` (fail-closed parser shared with chhttp).
- **inbound token is consumed, never forwarded**: `CAVEMAN_AUTH_TOKEN` gates non-loopback listens (a middleware token map, OIDC issuer or TLS client CA also makes one legal; provider routes still accept only the token, and without it `Auth.closed` refuses every provider request off loopback); `standalone.Auth` deletes the matching `x-cave-api-key`/`Authorization` header before `Creds.Resolve` so the shared token can never be forwarded to a provider or classified as a provider credential; a bearer that is not the token survives untouched (Claude OAuth, `/chatgpt/`). `Authenticate` runs BEFORE `matchAdapter` so the 401/404 split cannot be used to enumerate routes, and every 401 goes through `Server.rejectUnauthorized`, which counts `cave_proxy_unauthorized_total` and warns with the path and remote host only. Health and the no-op `/caveman/keepalive` beacon stay unauthenticated, `/metrics` too unless `CAVEMAN_METRICS_TOKEN` is set; the `X-Caveman-Instance` header on `/health/live` is published only on a loopback bind. A token on a LOOPBACK listener is honored too (the local `caveman wrap` path sends none, so `runServe` warns). Bedrock credentials then come from `shared/platform/awscreds` (env → web identity → container → IMDSv2), never from the request; a PARTIAL env pair fails closed instead of falling through to an ambient role, and the winning source is logged once.
- **middleware identity is server-side and per route**: `middleware.Config.Identify` resolves an `identity.Principal` from the credential alone (bearer decides when present, else a verified client certificate); `ServeHTTP`'s `decode` checks `Principal.Allows(scope.Namespace)` on EVERY scoped route, so a new route that skips `decode` skips authorization. The legacy token stays `single_operator` with every namespace; JWT and certificate principals may never be named `single_operator`. Token and hash comparisons are constant-time over every entry. A token map or TLS file that fails to reload keeps the previous one. Tests: `identity/*_test.go` (negative JWT and mTLS cases), `middleware/identity_test.go`.
- **Postgres middleware store keeps SQLite's single-writer semantics per authority**: `store.PostgresMiddleware` serializes writers of one authority with a transaction-scoped advisory lock taken by `Scope` (then re-read), `SaveScope`, `Revoke`, `PurgeBatch`, `Receipt` and `SaveOriginal`; the sweep is one-replica (try-lock) and skips busy authorities and row-locked scopes. Counters are statement-level transition-table triggers striped by txid; a per-row trigger goes quadratic on bulk statements. Lock keys include `current_schema()`. Run the store suite against both backends with `CAVEMAN_TEST_POSTGRES_URL`; `middleware_concurrency_test.go` fails without the locks.
- **Auth scheme is preserved**: a key from an inbound `Authorization: Bearer` keeps `Scheme:"bearer"` on the `providers.Credential`; Anthropic and Gemini forward bearer credentials as bearer credentials (Claude/Gemini OAuth breaks if remapped to an API-key header). BYOK env keys and inbound `x-api-key` keep provider API-key mapping.
  On a named compat mount the header follows the wire protocol of the path:
  `/compat/<name>/v1/messages` gets `x-api-key` plus a default
  `anthropic-version`, every other path gets Bearer. A real inbound Bearer stays
  Bearer on every path. OpenCode Go rejects Bearer
  on `/v1/messages` (401 `Missing API key.`, 2026-09-03). The gateway env
  fallback puts the key in the header that the adapter emitted, so the upstream
  never gets two credentials.
- **fail-closed**: unknown route → 404; unknown mode → `record`.
- **subscription AND oauth compression is NOT account-gated**: non-PAYG sessions from Claude Code, Codex ChatGPT, Gemini CLI, and other routed clients take live-zone compression with no Caveman account, entitlement, or seat. `CAVEMAN_WRAP_ENTITLED` and every `WrapEntitled` field are **deleted**, not merely ignored — do not reintroduce them. Exactly four conditions remain, all technical and all fail-closed (`liveZoneCompressionAllowed`): the operator `subscription_compress` switch (empty/`live_zone` allow, `off` and any unknown value close it), the adapter must implement schema-aware `PrefixStabilizer` zones, recovery must run through the agent's own MCP `caveman_retrieve`, and a durable prefix cache must be wired. The dedicated Codex `/chatgpt/responses` route uses the OpenAI Responses stabilizer while preserving OAuth and `ChatGPT-Account-ID` headers; recovery is proven by the `CAVEMAN_RECOVERY=mcp` stamp or the decoded request's own `mcp__caveman__caveman_retrieve` (top-level `tools` or Codex's `input[]` `additional_tools`, flat or under an MCP namespace); zstd bodies decode → transform → re-encode, anything else forwards the original wire bytes, and the `chatgpt_proxy` log carries `skip_reason`; transformed 4xx responses retry once with exact original bytes (never a rate-limit 429; an accepted retry pins the conversation raw). Legacy savings fields remain **tokens-only** — `compression_tokens_before/after` + `estimated_engine_o200k`, never booked compression dollars. New request-comparison and price-snapshot fields support separately labeled API equivalents in local stats; those values never enter subscription spend or legacy saved-dollar fields. LOCAL wrap only; managed gateway non-PAYG behavior is unchanged.
- **cache safety is byte-stable replacement**: THE INVARIANT (#1105): for accepted requests P then R of one conversation, if R's client bytes over P's cached prefix (system, tools and messages through P's last `cache_control` marker; the whole prompt for implicit caches) equal P's, R's forwarded bytes over that range equal P's, and every request caches at least what its client asked for (a dropped breakpoint is a bust too). Two exceptions, both re-caching the range raw: a request the provider rejected transformed and accepted through the raw retry, and a compressed PAYG conversation without MCP recovery that streams (the server-side retrieve tool cannot ride a stream, so the conversation stays raw from there). A raw retry splits a range into a raw and a replaced form, and a later request follows the LONGEST lineage it extends, ties going raw: it is held to the raw request (raw pin) unless it repeats a longer prefix that went out replaced, like a sibling subagent started with the same task. Pins are taken only on a conversation's own bytes (past system and tools); pins and lineages live in the PrefixCache (`rawpin` and `lineage` scopes, pin rows never evicted) and in memory. `internal/gateway/cache_prefix_invariant_test.go` (Anthropic compress, PAYG, pixel and Codex Responses scenarios + `FuzzCachePrefixInvariant`) proves it; keep it green. A compressed live-zone turn becomes prefix on the next request, so the replacement is a pure function of segment content (deterministic compressor + content-hash CCR marker), memoised in the durable replacement cache, and the FIRST decision for a block wins — replaced or raw (`RawDecisionHandle`); a request whose write finds a row on record sends that row, not its own candidate. A frozen block with no decision (a `--resume` history, an evicted row) goes out raw and raw becomes its decision; a failed memo write keeps the block raw for the process (`rawMemory`, consulted only on a store miss and written through once the store takes it); new rows are remembered only once the request's splice holds. Raw decisions are global and durable, a known savings cost: a block declined once (frozen at first sight, a compressor decline, a CCR failure, a non-newest parallel tool output) stays raw in every conversation. Bounding them needs a TTL of at least the longest provider retention (24 h for OpenAI extended caching) plus time-aware store interfaces, or per-conversation rows keyed on a stable conversation identity with a scope rollover. Substitution is never gated: the derived epoch gate is gone, and an explicit framework epoch may veto only NEW compression. Pixel renders and the tool-schema strip are memoised the same way. New compression stays live-zone-only. The runtime tripwire (`prefix_monitor.go`, on the provider routes and `/chatgpt`) checks the same rule on live traffic and records `requests.cache_bust_cause`: `client` (DEBUG); `raw_retry`, `stream_switch`, and `lever_freeze` (the harm tripwire's one-time strip rollover), all WARN; `caveman` (ERROR `caveman changed bytes the provider already cached` or `caveman dropped a cache breakpoint the client set`, counted as `caveman_cache_bust_requests` and raised by `caveman status`) — any `caveman` row is a bug. A request is held only to anchors accepted before its own forwarding decision. Cross-turn stability covers **anthropic, openai, azureopenai/openaicompat, and gemini** through `ExtractStabilizable`; `bedrock` and `vertex` expose no compressible blocks and stay pass-through. Anthropic uses declared `cache_control`; OpenAI/Gemini use latest-user/latest-tool zones against implicit provider caches. Replacement cache is SQLite spend store and must retain `journal_mode(WAL)` + `busy_timeout`; a hit rewrites `last_used_at` only once the row is 10 minutes stale, and pixel rows have their own cap inside the table's.
- **pixel mode**: S4 lossy text→PNG (`pxpipe` port). Default allowlist is `claude-fable-5,gpt-5.6` via `CAVE_PIXEL_MODELS`; savings stay inferred-only. Renders keep the compress rules: the first decision for a text (render or text) is re-sent on every turn, a raw pin keeps the conversation text, and a NEW render is remembered only once its request goes out, with the original stored in CCR and the splice holding. If either fails, the new content goes out as text and records that, and earlier renders still go. A rendered block's `cache_control` moves to its last image. An Anthropic request carries at most 20 images, client images included (`anthropicManyImages`): past 20 the API rejects any image over 2000 px, and the renders are 2573 px wide, so a new render past the cap stays text.
- **boundary**: this is public code — it must never import the managed-cloud lane. `make check-boundaries` enforces it.
