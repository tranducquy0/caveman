// carries no cloud coupling:
//
//   - Authenticator    accepts a request and returns its RuntimeMode + optimizer policy
//   - CredentialResolver resolves the upstream provider key (BYOK env or passthrough)
//   - TelemetrySink     records one truthful per-request spend row
//
// record mode is always a pass-through; on any transform problem the original
// bytes are forwarded unchanged. Standalone never claims `verified` savings — the
