// Every host that installs caveman shows the user a version, and reads it out
// of a different manifest. Those manifests were maintained by hand and drifted
// apart from the release (#107, #321):
//
//   .claude-plugin/plugin.json   no `version` key at all — `claude plugin list`
//                                falls back to the commit sha ("63e797cd753b"
//                                in #321) and `claude plugin update caveman`
//                                cannot resolve a version to compare against
//   gemini-extension.json        pinned at 1.0.1 — still what `gemini
//                                extensions list` reported to the reporter of
//                                #403 many releases later
//
// The release version itself already lives in two places that a test keeps
// honest: package.json `version`, and installer/install.js `PINNED_REF` (the
// immutable tag remote installs fetch from). These tests extend that guarantee
// to the manifests the hosts actually display, so a release bump can no longer
// leave a host reporting a version that has not shipped in a year.
//
// installer/install.js is deliberately not read from disk at runtime by the
// manifests — same reason as MIN_NODE_MAJOR in node-floor.test.mjs: the
// installer also runs detached from a checkout. The build is what holds them
// together.
