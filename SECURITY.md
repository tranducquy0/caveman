# Security and privacy

This document describes current repository behavior. Published releases can lag
source; verify the tag you install when policy depends on an exact version.

## Supported versions

| Component | Supported line | Security fixes |
|---|---|---|
| Caveman skill, installer, CLI (`@caveman-ai/cli`), runtime binaries (`bin-v*`, container image) | Latest stable release | Yes |
| SDKs: `@caveman-ai/sdk`, `caveman-sdk` | 1.2.x (latest 1.x minor) | Yes |
| Middleware: `@caveman-ai/middleware`, `caveman-middleware` | 1.x, latest minor | Yes |
| Middleware 0.x alphas (`0.1.0-alpha.*`, `0.1.0a1`) | — | No. Upgrade to 1.x. |
| Anything older than the lines above | — | No |

The `middleware` modules inside the SDKs (`@caveman-ai/sdk/middleware`,
`caveman_cloud.middleware`) get security fixes on the SDK 1.x line. From SDK
1.2.0 their API is stable and follows semver with the rest of the SDK, because
the 1.x middleware packages depend on it.

Response policy for reports sent through the channel below:

- acknowledgement within 3 business days;
- a fix or mitigation for a confirmed critical issue targeted within 30 days,
  with a published advisory once a fixed version is available.

These are policy targets for a small maintainer team, not a contractual SLA.

## Report a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for suspected arbitrary code execution, path escape,
credential exposure, proxy isolation failure, recovery-data exposure, or similar
security bugs. Use [GitHub private vulnerability
reporting](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/security/advisories/new).

## Data-flow summary

| Surface | Caveman account required? | Where content goes |
|---|---:|---|
| Caveman skill and classic output hooks | No | Local agent context and local files. These components do not directly call a Caveman service. |
| Local Proxy + Engine | No | Request content, possibly transformed, and provider credentials go to the provider selected by the agent. Recovery originals stay in local CCR storage unless the agent retrieves and sends them later. |
| Agent SDK `observe-only` | No | Directly to the configured provider. No Caveman gateway telemetry. |
| Managed Caveman gateway | Yes | Requests and responses transit Caveman Cloud and the selected provider. Do not treat managed mode as local-only. A managed Claude Code wrap also sends the launch repository (github.com `owner/name` only) and the current branch name on every request as `x-cave-tags`. Branch names can contain people's or customers' names: `CAVEMAN_WORK_TAGS=0` sends no tags, and your own `x-cave-tags` in `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` is sent exactly as set instead. |
| Framework middleware (client, adapters, and the runtime you host) | No | Your app keeps calling its provider directly. The adapters send eligible tool-result text to the runtime you point them at, and the runtime stores the originals so the model can fetch them back. Nothing goes to Caveman servers. See [Framework middleware data](#framework-middleware-data). |
| CLI usage telemetry | No | Content-free usage events, including token counts processed and saved, go to Caveman by default (opt-out) and are stored with the sender's IP address (IPs cleared after 90 days, events deleted after 13 months). First interactive run prints the disclosure; `caveman telemetry off` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` turns it off for good. |
| Authenticated dashboard sync | Yes | Local span metadata and aggregate findings go to Caveman Cloud when credentials are present. Raw prompt and response bodies are excluded. |

Your model provider, MCP servers, browser targets, agent plugins, and any command
the agent runs remain separate data processors. Caveman cannot make those tools
offline or private.

## Framework middleware data

The middleware client (`@caveman-ai/sdk/middleware`, `caveman_cloud.middleware`),
the adapters (`@caveman-ai/middleware`, `caveman-middleware`), and the
`caveman-proxy` runtime make **no network calls to Caveman servers**. They send
no telemetry. The client talks only to the runtime endpoint you configure; the
runtime answers the `/caveman/v1/middleware/*` routes and does not call a model
provider on this path. The Python import name `caveman_cloud` is historical: it
does not mean a cloud service is involved.

The CLI you may use to install and start the runtime (`caveman setup`,
`caveman start`) is a separate program with its own opt-out
[usage telemetry](#cli-usage-telemetry): content-free usage events,
never prompts or tool results. Turn it off with `caveman telemetry off` or
`DO_NOT_TRACK=1`. Running the binary or container image directly
(`caveman-proxy serve`) involves no CLI and no telemetry.

What the runtime stores, on its own disk, or in the Postgres database you point
it at with `CAVEMAN_MIDDLEWARE_DATABASE_URL` when several replicas share one
store:

- **Tool-result originals** (exact text), so the model can recover them. Treat
  them as sensitive as the tool output itself.
- **Scope state** in the runtime database (`~/.caveman/caveman.db`, or under
  `CAVEMAN_HOME` in the container): scope identifiers (namespace, session,
  branch, cache epoch), the compressed replacement text the runtime chose,
  recovery grants, and receipts. The replacement text is derived from tool
  output, so it is sensitive too. No provider credentials, no model responses.

Lifecycle **before runtime `bin-v2.0.0`**: originals go into the
shared recovery store (`~/.caveman/ccr.db`) in plaintext and are not deleted
when a session is deleted or expires; retention (`retention_seconds`, default
24 hours) covers scope metadata only. Delete the recovery store yourself when
you need the originals gone.

Lifecycle **from runtime `bin-v2.0.0`**:

- originals live in the middleware store and belong to their scope, not to the
  shared recovery store;
- `retention_seconds` covers originals too, and a `max_retention_seconds` cap
  bounds sliding renewal;
- deleting a session (`sessions/delete`) deletes the scope's metadata and every
  original it owns, and reports `originals_deleted: true` with counts;
- originals are encrypted at rest when an encryption key is configured;
  without a key they rely on file permissions, as today;
- an original from a call that produced no replacement is not kept.

The normative rules are in the protocol spec,
[`docs/technical/middleware-protocol.md`](./docs/technical/middleware-protocol.md)
(section 12, Lifecycle).

## CLI usage telemetry

Telemetry is **on by default and opt-out**.
The default is never silent: the first interactive command persists the decision
(with a stable random install ID) and prints a one-line disclosure naming the
scope and the off switch. Nothing sends before that disclosure run, and CI /
non-interactive runs never persist the default. Once a yes is persisted, agent
sessions started through caveman's native hooks (which have no terminal) also
send a `session_start` event from a background process. Login is not
required; events go to `https://xvfgtprkhzlvegvmeefq.supabase.co/functions/v1/cli-telemetry`,
a Supabase Edge Function that validates each event and stores it in Caveman's
Supabase database. Its source and table schema live in [`supabase/`](./supabase/).

```bash
caveman telemetry status
caveman telemetry on
caveman telemetry off
```

Controls, in precedence order:

- non-empty, non-zero `DO_NOT_TRACK` forces telemetry off;
- `CAVEMAN_TELEMETRY=1|true|on` enables it and other non-empty values disable it;
- CI is always off; a non-interactive run (such as a native agent hook) sends
  only under a yes already persisted by an interactive run, and never persists
  one itself;
- otherwise the persisted choice in `~/.caveman-cloud/config.json` applies —
  a persisted opt-out (from any version, including the old opt-in prompt's "no")
  is honored forever;
- no persisted choice means on, persisted with a printed disclosure on the
  first interactive command.

Agent hooks started by desktop apps or background services may never read your
shell profile, so an environment variable alone can miss them. When an
interactive command sees `DO_NOT_TRACK` or `CAVEMAN_TELEMETRY=0` while the saved
choice is on, it saves a lasting opt-out. `caveman telemetry off` does the same
immediately.

`CAVEMAN_TELEMETRY_URL` overrides the destination, mainly for testing. Events are
sent by a detached background process that gives up after 10 seconds, so no
command waits on the network; if that process cannot start, the CLI sends
in-process with a 1.5-second limit. Failures never fail the CLI command. The
request is a JSON `POST` with no browser headers; the receiver drops requests
that carry `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` or are not `application/json`, so a web
page cannot post events on a visitor's behalf.

When the disclosed scope widens, the persisted decision carries the wording
version it was made under. A wider scope reprints the disclosure once on the next
interactive command and bumps the stored version; it never re-asks, never flips a
decision, and never touches a persisted opt-out. Version 4 added the token
totals below; version 5 added the IP address, agent session starts, account
and install type, timezone, and locale.

This telemetry is pseudonymous, not anonymous: the install ID links one
install's events together, and the stored IP address shows where they came
from. IP addresses are cleared from stored events after 90 days, and whole
events are deleted 13 months after they were received. Separately, Supabase's
platform request logs record each request's IP address and approximate location derived by Cloudflare (city,
region, country, network) for the Supabase plan's log retention period; the
90-day clearing covers the events table, not those logs.

Events can contain:

- the IP address the request came from, as seen by Supabase's edge network
  (not a value the client can set). Stored with every event and used to
  rate-limit each sender; the server also records when it received the event;
- event name and client timestamp; random install ID; CLI version; OS;
  architecture; Node major version;
- account state (signed in or not, and the cached plan name), how the CLI was
  installed (npm, npx, pnpm, bun, or a source checkout; never the path),
  timezone, and locale;
- agent session starts: which agent launched (Claude Code, Codex, ...) and
  whether the session was new, resumed, or cleared, sent once per host session
  by the native SessionStart hook, with the same token increment described
  below;
- allowlisted command, subcommand, and known agent ID; duration; outcome; broad
  error class;
- tokens processed and tokens saved by the local Proxy, as the increment since
  the last event rather than lifetime totals, always carrying their measurement
  basis (`inferred` — tokenizer estimates, never billed counts, never a dollar
  figure). Read as an aggregate over the local store; when no store or Proxy
  binary is present the fields are omitted rather than reported as zero. The
  first read on a machine only records a baseline and reports nothing, so a store
  holding traffic from before this disclosure is never reported retroactively;
- local Proxy session aggregates: request and token counts, compression-eligible
  request counts, compression before/after/saved token counts, estimated cuts,
  cache read/write token counts, cache-bust request counts, measurement mode, and
  headline-suppression state;
- first-run aggregate scan counts from local Claude Code or Codex history,
  including sessions, tokens, estimated cuts, scan timing, whether the scan
  succeeded, hit its time limit, or used the local Engine, and whether an
  account was already connected;
- Caveman MCP tool name, duration, and outcome.

Telemetry does **not** include prompt or completion bodies, raw argv,
file paths, tool arguments or results, provider credentials, or local database
rows/files. Source enforcement and runtime tests live in
[`packages/cli/src/index.ts`](./packages/cli/src/index.ts),
[`packages/cli/tests/telemetry.runtime.mjs`](./packages/cli/tests/telemetry.runtime.mjs),
and the receiving side in
[`supabase/functions/cli-telemetry/`](./supabase/functions/cli-telemetry/), which
stores only the fields listed above and drops malformed events.

### Delete sent telemetry

`caveman telemetry status` shows your install ID while telemetry is on.
`caveman telemetry off` removes the ID from your machine and prints it once as
`discarded_anonymous_id`; an interactive command that turns telemetry off
because of `DO_NOT_TRACK` or `CAVEMAN_TELEMETRY=0` prints it too. Keep it: it is
the only way to find your events, because Caveman does not know which install
is yours.

To have every stored event for an install ID deleted, send the ID through
[GitHub private vulnerability
reporting](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman/security/advisories/new)
with "telemetry deletion" in the title. Deletion covers the events table;
Supabase's platform request logs expire on their own schedule and cannot be
deleted per install.

## Authenticated Caveman Cloud traffic

Connected commands require stored credentials or `CAVE_TOKEN`; new logins are
blocked during beta. Sync sends usage metadata and aggregate findings, never
prompts, responses, credentials, tool evidence, or source paths. Subscription
traffic omits dollar figures, and synced local data remains `inferred`. Managed
gateway mode carries request and response content through Caveman Cloud; local
mode sends it only to your provider. `CAVEMAN_OFFLINE=1` disables entitlement
refresh and sync, but opted-in telemetry needs `CAVEMAN_TELEMETRY=0` or
`DO_NOT_TRACK=1` too.

## Local storage

Caveman stores runtime data under `~/.caveman/` and account/config state under
`~/.caveman-cloud/` unless a documented environment override changes a path.
Important files include:

- `~/.caveman/caveman.db`: per-request metadata, usage, local savings estimates,
  transformed prefix replacements, and related local evidence. Normal request
  rows do not store raw request or response bodies, but transformed content can
  remain in this database. Treat it as sensitive.
- `~/.caveman/ccr.db`: exact originals for recoverable transforms. This file can
  contain prompts, credentials embedded in content, and tool results. Treat it
  as sensitive.
- explicit `caveman trial` runs store raw request payloads in the local
  `trial_payloads` table for replay. Reports exclude those payloads.
- local learn/first-run scans read supported Claude Code and Codex history files
  and write aggregate reports/state locally. Raw session content is not included
  in CLI telemetry or authenticated scan sync.
- `~/.caveman-cloud/config.json`: endpoints, project/account pointers, telemetry
  decision, and other CLI state.
- account credentials: macOS Keychain when available, otherwise
  `~/.caveman/credentials` with file mode `0600`. `CAVE_TOKEN` remains owned by
  the parent environment.

CCR SQLite files and sidecars are created or tightened to mode `0600` and refuse
unsafe symlink/non-regular-file paths. This is filesystem access control, not
database encryption. Default retained CCR payload budget is 512 MiB;
`CAVEMAN_CCR_MAX_BYTES` can change it. Existing recovery handles are never
evicted. When the budget is exhausted, new recovery writes fail and lossy
transforms must fall back to pass-through.

Uninstall removes installed integrations and hooks. Do not assume it erases
runtime databases, reports, backups, or credentials; inspect `~/.caveman/` and
`~/.caveman-cloud/` separately if data deletion is required.

## Local Proxy security

`caveman start` defaults to `127.0.0.1:8787`. Without `CAVEMAN_AUTH_TOKEN`,
the proxy accepts every inbound request, because loopback single-operator
isolation is the security boundary, and startup rejects a non-loopback `--host`
or `CAVEMAN_LISTEN` value.

A non-loopback listener needs an inbound credential: `CAVEMAN_AUTH_TOKEN` (at
least 16 bytes, no spaces or control characters), or one of the middleware
identity sources below. The container image listens on `0.0.0.0:8787`, so it
refuses to start without one.

- **Provider routes** (inference) accept only `CAVEMAN_AUTH_TOKEN`, in
  `x-cave-api-key` or `Authorization: Bearer`: one shared secret, the operator's
  authority over the server's provider keys. Without it on a non-loopback
  listener they refuse every request.
- **Framework middleware routes** (from runtime `bin-v2.0.0`) resolve a
  principal per caller: the shared token (`single_operator`, every namespace),
  a token map of SHA-256 token hashes to principals with namespace globs and
  quotas (several tokens per principal, so rotation needs no outage; reloaded on
  change or `SIGHUP`), an OIDC/JWT bearer checked against the issuer's key set
  (RS256/ES256 only, fetched over https only, redirects included), or a TLS
  client certificate. Principal names carry their source and are compared byte
  for byte: `oidc:<issuer>#<claim>`, `mtls:uri:<SAN>`, `mtls:dns:<SAN>`, and
  `mtls:cn:<CN>` only when `CAVEMAN_TLS_CLIENT_CN_FALLBACK` is set. So no JWT or
  certificate can take over a token principal's sessions by spelling its name,
  and no token map entry for such a principal may carry a token. Each principal
  reaches only its own sessions, and its allowed namespaces are enforced
  server-side on every route (`403 forbidden_namespace`). Every middleware
  request writes one audit line with the principal and how it authenticated,
  never content. A token map that fails to reload keeps the previous one,
  revoked tokens included, and is counted in
  `caveman_identity_reload_failures_total`: alert on it.
- **TLS:** `CAVEMAN_TLS_CERT_FILE` / `CAVEMAN_TLS_KEY_FILE` serve TLS 1.2+
  directly, reloaded on change; `CAVEMAN_TLS_CLIENT_CA_FILE` adds mTLS, and a
  client certificate is re-checked against the current CA on every request, so
  replacing the CA also cuts live keep-alive connections. Without them the
  proxy speaks plain HTTP: terminate TLS in front of it.
- `/health/*` stay unauthenticated for load balancers; `/metrics` does too
  unless `CAVEMAN_METRICS_TOKEN` is set.

Still not provided: per-user identity or roles on the provider routes, and an
audit log for them beyond the counted and logged rejections. Keep any shared
listener on a private network. A firewall alone does not make it an
authenticated external gateway. Configuration and examples:
[`docs/technical/deploy.md`](./docs/technical/deploy.md#identity).

Proxy upstream clients apply SSRF controls. Compression is recovery-first:
parse failure, unsafe transform, unavailable durable recovery, storage failure,
or a result that is not smaller returns original bytes instead of a lossy
replacement. This reduces corruption risk; it does not make model output or
third-party tools trustworthy.

## Install and update network access

Network installers fetch source from GitHub and may invoke npm or agent-specific
registries. Per-agent installers can contact Anthropic/GitHub, Gemini extension,
the Oh My Pi plugin manager, npm, or other configured registries. Detached hook
installation downloads files pinned to a release tag (never the moving `main`
branch) and checks each against the SHA-256 manifest committed at that same
tag. If that manifest cannot be fetched or any file does not match, no hook is
installed and `settings.json` is not changed. That catches corrupt, partial, or
mismatched downloads; because manifest
and files come from the same tag, it does not protect against the tag itself
being moved. Git tags in this repository are not yet protected against moves or
deletion, and GitHub immutable releases are not yet enabled. Runtime companion
setup downloads a checksum manifest, verifies its signature against the public
key compiled into the CLI, then verifies each binary's SHA-256 against that
manifest before installation. A valid manifest needs the signing key, which is
stored only as a secret of the release workflow's environment, so editing a tag
or release page cannot forge one. From runtime `bin-v2.0.0` the signed manifest
also names its release (a `RELEASE` entry: the SHA-256 of the attached
`RELEASE` file, which holds the tag), and `caveman setup --install` and
`caveman update` refuse a manifest that does not name the exact release the CLI
pins, so an older signed manifest and its binaries cannot be served in its
place. A CLI pinned to an earlier runtime accepts a manifest without the entry.
The standalone binary installers in the browse, MCP, and shrink npm packages
pin `bin-v2.0.0` and always require that entry, on top of the signature and
each digest.

For inspection-first installation, clone a pinned tag and run the local installer
instead of piping a remote script into a shell. A source clone avoids installer
downloads only when required dependencies and runtime binaries are already
available locally.

## Scanner warnings

- Windows Defender or SmartScreen can flag `install.ps1` because it pipes a
  downloaded script into PowerShell and writes agent configuration. Clone and
  inspect the pinned source first if policy forbids pipe-to-shell installation.
- Generic scanners can flag `caveman-compress` because it rewrites the file the
  user names and creates a backup. That file mutation is intentional. Review
  [`skills/caveman-compress/`](./skills/caveman-compress/) before enabling it.
- Snyk Agent Scan W007 ("insecure credential handling") can fire on `caveman`
  and `caveman-compress`. The trigger is the rule that code blocks, commands,
  API names, and exact error strings stay verbatim. That rule stops the model
  from corrupting a stack trace, a command, or a secret while it shortens
  prose. It creates no new place for data to go. The `caveman` skill is
  instructions only: no scripts, no network calls, no extra tool access.
  By default `caveman-compress` sends only the file you name to Anthropic
  (through the API or your `claude` CLI) and writes back only that file and its
  backup. If you opt in with `CAVEMAN_COMPRESS_PROVIDER=opencode` or
  `openai-compat`, the file goes to that provider, or to the endpoint you set in
  `CAVEMAN_COMPRESS_ENDPOINT`, instead (opencode also gets the prompt through a
  temporary file that is deleted afterwards); see
  [`skills/caveman-compress/SECURITY.md`](./skills/caveman-compress/SECURITY.md#auth-behavior).
  Text either skill keeps verbatim is text you already gave the model.
- Skill scanners (Snyk Agent Scan, `npx skills` risk ratings) can rate
  `caveman-setup` high risk because it handles a credential. It is the Caveman
  Cloud onboarding skill. It acts only when you ask it to set up the gateway and
  supply `CAVE_API_KEY`. It puts that key in the env file your repo already
  uses, makes sure that file is gitignored, never prints the key in full, and
  points LLM callsites at the gateway URL you give it. If you do not use Caveman
  Cloud, install only the core skill:
  `npx skills add JuliusBrussee/caveman --skill caveman`.
